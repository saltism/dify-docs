# Initialize Development Tools

Before start to develop Dify plugins please prepare the following prerequisites:

* Dify plugin scaffolding tool
* Python environment, version ≥ 3.12

### **1. Installing the Dify Plugin Scaffolding Tool**

Visit the [Dify plugin GitHub page](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugin-daemon/releases) and select and download the version suitable for your operating system.

Using **macOS with M-series chips** as an example: Download the `dify-plugin-darwin-arm64` file from the project address mentioned above. Then, in the terminal, navigate to the file's location and grant it execution permissions:

```
chmod +x dify-plugin-darwin-arm64
```

Run the following command to verify successful installation.

```
./dify-plugin-darwin-arm64 version
```

> If the system shows an "Apple cannot verify" error, go to **Settings → Privacy & Security → Security**, and click the "Open Anyway" button.

After running the command, the installation is successful, if the terminal returns version information like `v0.0.1-beta.15`.

**Tips:**

If you want to use the `dify` command globally in your system to run the scaffolding tool, it's recommended to rename the binary file to `dify` and copy it to the `/usr/local/bin` system path.

After configuration, entering the `dify version` command in the terminal will output the version number.
