# Initialize Development Tools

Before start to develop Dify plugins please prepare the following prerequisites:

### **Prerequisites**

* Dify plugin scaffolding tool
* Python environment, version ≥ 3.12

#### **1. Installing the Dify Plugin Scaffolding Tool**&#x20;

Visit the [Dify plugin GitHub page](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugin-daemon/releases) and select and download the version suitable for your operating system.

Using **macOS with M-series chips** as an example: Download the `dify-plugin-darwin-arm64` file from the project address mentioned above. Then, in the terminal, navigate to the file's location and grant it execution permissions:

```
chmod +x dify-plugin-darwin-arm64
```

Run the following command to verify successful installation:

```
./dify-plugin-darwin-arm64 version
```

> If the system shows an "Apple cannot verify" error, go to Settings → Privacy & Security → Security, and click the "Open Anyway" button.

After running the command, if the terminal returns version information like `v0.0.1-beta.15`, the installation was successful.

> If you want to use the `dify` command globally in your system to run the scaffolding tool, it's recommended to rename the binary file to `dify` and copy it to the `/usr/local/bin` system path.
>
> After configuration, entering the `dify -v` command in the terminal will output the version number.

#### **2. Initialize Python Environment**&#x20;

For detailed instructions, please refer to the [Python installation](https://pythontest.com/python/installing-python-3-11/) tutorial, or ask the LLM for complete installation instructions.
