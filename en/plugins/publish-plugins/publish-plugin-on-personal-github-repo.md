# Publish to Your Personal GitHub Repository

You can install plugins through GitHub repository links. After developing a plugin, you can choose to publish it to a public GitHub repository for others to download and use. This method offers the following advantages:

• **Personal Management**: Complete control over plugin code and updates

• **Quick Sharing**: Easily share with other users or team members via GitHub links for testing and use

• **Collaboration and Feedback**: Open-sourcing your plugin may attract potential collaborators on GitHub who can help improve it quickly

This guide will show you how to publish plugins to a GitHub repository.

### **Prerequisites**

* GitHub account
* New public GitHub repository
* Git tools installed locally

For basic GitHub knowledge, please refer to [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

### **1. Prepare Plugin Project**

Publishing to public GitHub means your plugin will be open source. Ensure you've completed debugging and verification, and have a comprehensive `README.md` file.

Recommended README contents:

* Plugin introduction and feature description
* Installation and configuration steps
* Usage examples
* Contact information or contribution guidelines

### **2. Initialize Local Plugin Repository**

Before publishing to GitHub, ensure debugging and verification are complete. Navigate to the plugin project folder in terminal and run:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add plugin files"
```

If this is your first time using Git, you may also need to configure your Git username and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### **3. Connect Remote Repository**

Use this command to connect local repository to GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
```

### **4. Upload Plugin Files**

Push project to GitHub repository:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Recommended to add tags for future packaging:

```bash
git tag -a v0.0.1 -m "Release version 0.0.1"
git push origin v0.0.1
```

### **5. Package Plugin Code**

Go to the Releases page of your GitHub repository and create a new release. Upload plugin files when publishing. For detailed instructions on packaging plugins, please read the packaging plugins documentation.
